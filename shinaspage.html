     <p>My name is Ni Luh Ayu Sukrisna Dewi, 25 years old and keen to reaching my life goals. I was born in Bali, Indonesia.</p><p>Life flies so fast and now I'm working as an accountant in one of the restaurant in Bali.</p><p>I just felt like I graduated yesterday from my university and now I've been working in hospitality sector for <em>four years</em>.</p>
<p>When I graduated from Junior High School, I was confused about my future, should I choose Senior High School or Vocational High School?</p>
<p>On that day I was thinking that I won't take my bachelor degree because of my family state so the best choice for me was to go to Vocational High School.</p>
<p>Finally I choose Accountant as my major. Here my photo when I was in Vocational High School with all of my girls classmate <em>(no male student in my class).</em> <br></p>

    <div id="my life journey">
     <p>During my university life, I spent my time 3 years and 8 months until I got my bachelor degree.</p>
<p>In July, 2016 I officially got <strong>Sarjana Ekonomi</strong> behind my name. <em>Ni Luh Ayu Sukrisna Dewi, SE</em> </p> <p>I really understand that I need to face the reality and become an adult.</p> <p>After I got my degree, I went around to put my CV and resume in some private corporate and I was scared to apply in hospitality sector because of lack English language.</p>
<p>However, in the end of July 2016, I accepted as Account Receivable and Income Audit at DeKuta Hotel.</p> <p>I learned many things about hotel transaction and operational.</p> <p><em>"I can't work in the hotel if I'm not able to speak English. I have to join an English Course,"<em/> that was what I'm thinking after I got my first paycheck.</p> <p>Then I joined Business English Elemantary Level at English First for six months.</p>
