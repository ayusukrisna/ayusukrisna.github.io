As an accountant, understanding Microsoft Excel is important because many of my tasks require using spreadsheets (the rest require a specialised accounting system!). Microsoft Excel has grown to become one of the most important computer software applications in workplaces around the world, especially if you work in the Accounting and Finance Department.

I started learning Excel in Junior High School, and deepened my knowledge in Vocational High School. I would say that I have an intermediate skill level of excel, however it’s not good enough to build an automated report. If you have advance skill level for excel you can make your work much more effectively and efficiently. Last year, I only knew the basic excel formulas such as SUM, SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, etc, so I was a quite slow to prepare my financial reports. 

When my boyfriend [Jet](https://www.jetholt.com/){:target="_blank"} visited Bali in 2019, he told me about Excel Macros and VBA Scripts. He helped me to upgrade my formula and made my work a lot of easier. On that day, when Jet told me about Macros, I found it too complicated to understand and I just let him to do that all by himself. 

It made me feel that I needed to learn Macros to upgrade my career so recently I enrolled in a Udemy accounting course to improve my excel skills. It’s exciting and I have found out so many things that I didn’t know before. Excel provided a lot of functions, shortcuts, and formulas as long as you know how to work with it.

Here is the name of the course on udemy.com: The Financial Analyst Course 2020. You can learn about excel, accounting, financial statement analysis, business analysis, financial math, and also power point. Everything is included! Don’t worry if you are a beginner, because this course is suitable for beginners. 

Here the example one of the subject;

Thanks to Udemy, now I can learn even more about excel at my own pace and build my career too.
