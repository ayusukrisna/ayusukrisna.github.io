Since this corona virus outbreak is happening all around the world and forced us to stay at home as well as we can’t go to work made me realized that I need to do something to reach my goals. I never think about online course before, I don’t even know if this course is existing. When I found out my goal to have a remote job and what kind of job I can do so I think Digital Marketing is suitable for me. I love learning about digital world and in this century, we spend almost all of our time on digital such as social media, exploring on google, and so on.

I have a friend who is successfully a digital marketer in Bali, I said to him I want to switch my carrier from accounting to digital marketing. He told me to start with Google Garage first. Wow, Google has free online courses and I just found out about it. So, I signed up and start for my first online course. It’s really interesting to me, the course also easy to understand. They give us example and explain thing in clear way. Once we finish our entire course about the fundamental of digital marketing, google garage will give us the final exam and we need to pass 80% of answering correctly all the questions. If you pass it you will get your certificate in pdf. Congratulation!

Besides of google garage, I also enroll on Udemy.com course. They have a motto that Improving Lives Through Learning. Udemy has so many online course categories and we can access it from all around the world. I enroll on Content Digital Marketing, and as well as Financial and Business Analyst. Since I’m an accountant I also want to improve my skill. 

[Robert Kiyosaki](https://www.richdad.com/){:target="_blank"} said that we need to learn not only one skill. Especially when you want to build your own emperor. In Rich Dad Poor Dad, Kiyosaki names the following seven skills as being prime skills to help you become wealthy:

1.	Accounting;

2.	Investing;

3.	Marketing;

4.	Law;

5.	Copywriting;

6.	Sales;

7.	Public Relations;

Since I already have the Accounting skill, I made up my mind to learn those skills above step by, start with Digital Marketing.

Udemy gives much discount in this pandemic situation and for one course I only paid IDR 140.000 (USD 10), in which the normal price is IDR 2.800.000 (USD 200). I enroll two courses for my accounting skill such as Financial Analyst and Business Analytics. I made up my mind to make the best use of time.

Another course that I’m taking is Codecademy, because I want to develop my own personal website. Codecademy teach me so well, the explanation and then the example are easy to understand especially for beginners. Actually, Codecademy provide practice after we finish the course, however we need to enroll Codecademy Pro. I just completed HTML course and now is progressing my CSS. The last one will be the Javascript.
