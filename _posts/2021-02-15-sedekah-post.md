When you get your paycheck every month, what will you do first? Transfer to your savings account? Pay your bills? Buy something online?

Do you ever think that share some amount of money to people who need our help? 

For me, sharing what we have bring a positive impact to our lives. Sharing isn’t just about money. We can share our knowledge, time, and support, too. There is a sense of relief when we are able to share and help others. Sincerity is the main key of sharing. No matter how much money you give to others, if you want something back, it won’t add anything to your life.

A few days ago, I met a woman called Padma. She was a guest in my workplace. She asked me where she can meet people who live in poverty. She and her partner will celebrate their anniversary, and they want to share with other people on that day. They want to help and spread their love. She asked for some suggestion of the kinds of things she can give to them. Her plan is to give 50 bags of rice and primer needs, blankets, and so on. She and her partner are so generous and have lovely hearts. She is inspiring to me.

Sometimes, I feed stray dogs and cats with leftover food. I feel like my heart is full of happiness when I see the animals eat what I gave to them. They are always so hungry and eat very fast. I cannot bear to see an animal in these terrible situations, I feel sorrow and want to help them. I don’t understand why some people harm animals? One of my friends on Facebook posted that he found kittens inside the box and two of them were dead. Somebody had thrown the box away with the kittens inside. I’m hateful when I saw that post. I offered a help to buy cat milk for them. I feel grateful that there are still many good people in this world.

In Indonesia, there is an App that we can use to help people by donating through that App. It’s called KitaBisa (in English this translates to “We Can”). I already used it for few a months - every time I got my paycheck I donate a little. I can choose to donate to anyone and it’s very easy to use. Can you imagine if you were in a bad situation, and nobody helped you? So, I try my best to help people and animals. 

One of my goals in 2021 is that I will donate and make an event in an orphanage. I did something similar to this in 2012 with my group campus. We were laughing, caring and loving and the children had a good time too. They deserve to be happy and feel loved.
