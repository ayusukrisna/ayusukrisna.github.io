Today, I wrote my first page in HTML all by myself. It is called shina's page and you can get to it by clicking here! 
[Shina's First Page](https://shinaspage/)

Here's a screenshot of the page I made:

I'm also learning about markdown when I write this post, and I will compare it to HTML

This is the equivalent of a `<h1>` element!
`# H1`
# H1

This is the equivalent of a `<b>` element!
`**bold text**`
**bold-tebal**

This is the equivalent of an `<i>` element!
`*italic*`
*italic-miring*

This is the equivalent of a `<u>` element!
Unfortunately, markdown doesn't have underline text.
