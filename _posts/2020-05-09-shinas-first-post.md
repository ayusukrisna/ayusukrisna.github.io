Hai, I'm Ni Luh Ayu Sukrisna Dewi, and you can call me either Ni or Shina. Currently works in accounting for a restaurant in Bali.

Because of the situation at my workplace - exacerbated by the Coronavirus Pandemic - I'm looking to increase my skillset so that I'm not dependent on working in Bali.

I’ve been learning digital marketing, and my boyfriend Jet's been helping me. He doesn’t know much about buying, selling, and optimising ads, but he know enough about analytics, search engines, SEO, etc to help me to understand the basic.
