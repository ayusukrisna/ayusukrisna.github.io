Do you ever think about *why do you live in this world?*

Sometimes when I have a bad day and feel sad because of family, work, relationship and friendship, I always ask to myself, ‘what is the purpose of this life?’. We experienced many things such as excitement, joy, sadness and sorrow. I used to wake up in the morning and did my routine without feeling grateful. When I have happy things I laughed, when sad things happened, I cried.

However, since the beginning of 2020 I find my way and the purpose I live. To be a successful person, have a beautiful love life and financial abundance are my goals! I know to get all of them is not easy at all, furthermore challenging. As long as I have faith in myself, feel that I already have all of my goals (it’s called ‘law of attraction’) and be grateful, one day I definetely can reach my goals!

Mindset is the key. Having a growth **mindset** (the belief that you are in control of your own ability, and can learn and improve) is the **key to success**. We need to control our mind especially when we experienced hard time.

**A blessing in disguise** is something that appears to be a misfortune can have unexpected benefits (Wikipedia). Back in 2018, I didn’t want to be an accountant at restaurant and I just want to be accountant hotel, but my boss took me out from the hotel and asked me to handle accounting at his restaurant. Honestly, I was so sad because it was against my will. Yeah, I thought it was misfortune. But at the end of the day I can be an accountant supervisor (despite just an accounting staff) at the well-known restaurant and I feel so grateful because I still can work in this pandemic whilst all of my colleagues are laid off.

Back in 2016, I broke up with my Ex and made me don’t believe with Long Distance Relationship (LDR) also I hate gamers guys. Broke up is sucks but in 2019 I find a new love and LDR isn’t that bad when you are in relationship with the right guy who can manage communication well and fond each other.

No matter what happen in your life, you deserve to be happy and get much better result with your work together with efforts. Don’t be sad for too long and the most important thing is DON’T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAM!
