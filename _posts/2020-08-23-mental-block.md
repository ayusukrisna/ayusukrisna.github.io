Do you ever say to yourself that *“you can’t do that”*, *“you don’t deserve it”*, *“you are not worthy”*, *"I don't want to take any risks"* and so on, then you have mental blocks. Hina Hashmi from Your Life A Practical Guide to Happiness Peace and Fulfilment said, *“If you experience any emotion like frustration, hesitation or anger, while planning your dream life, means you need to clear some mental blocks”.*

When you have some goals in your life but your mental is blocking you, you need to control yourself and change the mental block into building block. Recently, I listen on some podcast and videos on youtube were talking about mental block. It can be dangerous for young generation; they think they cannot achieve something meanwhile they able to do it if they believe in their selves.

Actually, I had some mental blocks until I can control it. For example, I used to think I couldn’t run for 10km, it would be hard for me, my heart rate wouldn’t bear it, and bla bla bla. So, in 2018 I only ran maximum 6km and never tried more than that. My friend is a psychologist and he said to me, “you should believe in yourself Shina you can do more than this, I believe you can achieve 10km of running! Semangat (fighting)”. I was trying to do 10km with my runner friends and wow I could do that and I even run for 12,5km at RTYD event (Run till You Drop). Then in 2019 I registered for Maybank Bali Marathon for 10km category, I finished with 1 hour and 17 minutes. I’m so proud of myself, I know I can make it and I did!

11.	The most important thing is BELIEVE in yourself. 

From mental blocks being [building blocks](https://www.signalsaz.com/articles/5-critical-building-blocks-for-mental-wellness/){:target="_blank"} need some character assets such as honesty, hope, faith, courage, integrity, willingness, humility, love, discipline, perseverance, spirituality, and service to others. The only asset that we need to control is our MIND. Everything we do and say is from our mind. Napoleon Hill with his book Think and Grow Rich said “One of the main weaknesses of the human race is the average person’s familiarity with the word impossible.” He also said, “Faith is a state of mind which may be induced, or created, by affirmations or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind, through the principle of autosuggestion.”

One day, you can reach you goals and successfully overcome your mental blocks. Be healthy and **don’t give up**. Whatever happens, let it happens.
