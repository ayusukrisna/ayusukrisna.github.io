Most of people think that run is a tiring exercise and need a lot of energy to do that. Yeah, I used to think the same thing, and every time I imagined do a run, I felt my heart suffocating! In the end of 2017, my friend asked me to run together with him and his running group. Actually, I wasn’t interested but because he asked me, I said yes. I ran for 5 kilometers and for me it was so challenging, I couldn’t breath properly, my legs felt heavy to take each step, thirsty, and I just made them ran slowly (because they need to waited for me!).

My first attempt wasn’t bad and the next day I challenged myself to do a 5 km alone. I ran in the field near my house, I did 10 times loop. Hurray, my average pace was 7:48/km. When you have willpower you can do it, yes you do.

Throughout 2018, I joined many of running race. Even just 5 km category, I proud of myself. I have bunch of medals; it doesn’t matter for me to pay registration fee and join a race because the hype makes me really excited! The medal you got is a proof that you accomplished the race and finish with RUNDERFUL feeling.

I feel so grateful that I have friends who love running and always courage me to do it. We are not just run along the way. We also find some beautiful spots to take some photos. We love running photography. My running group is called 5.30 (five thirty). We took very nice photos with a good pose.

In 2019, my boyfriend Jet and I also joined a race called Run till You Drop (RTYD). I did 2 hours run non-stop and Jet did 3 hours run non-stop. You can read it about our RTYD experienced [here](https://jetholt.com/run-till-you-drop//){:target="_blank"} . Jet always say this, **“What would Goggins do?”** every time I feel lazy to do a run. David Goggins is an American ultramarathon runner, he never limits himself as well as us. Yes, you can do 10km – 42km run, as long as you believe in yourself.

Time flies so fast, my last race was in September 2019 called Maybank Bali Marathon (MBM). I joined 10k category, there were bunch of runners joined this race (local and foreigners). I can say that MBM is the biggest event in Bali which is held every year. Unfortunately, this year 2020 because of the pandemic, MBM has to be cancelled. I hope I can join another race again soon. I miss the hype and running together with a lot of runners make me proud! Here I posed with my MBM medal.
