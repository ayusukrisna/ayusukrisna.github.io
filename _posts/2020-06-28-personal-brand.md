Basically, everyone has their own personal branding and what the *personal branding* is?  Personal Branding is how a person develops and maximizes his potential or skills, behavior and understands the superior value of what he wants to do and wants to achieve in himself. Honestly, I just found out about the personal branding and it’s important to make people acknowledge your existence. 

Thinking about my own, I’m still confused to determine my own personal branding. Then, I looked for some information about it and how we can develop our personal branding. First thing first we need to know what we are good at and what is our passion? Let’s focus on our strengths. I’m an accountant in hospitality sector, I have Microsoft Excel skills and able to operate accounting system. I love workout and running, and how I manage my social accounts are mostly to share those activities. I’m sociable, it easy for me to connect with new people. 

I found a quiz about personal branding, and it has 10 question. You can click it [here]( https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/what-is-your-personal-brand-quiz/){target="_blank"} to try the quiz. Here is my result:

I love to get attention and engagement with people. Recently, I posted some videos to my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shinatakashi/){ target="_blank"}. One of the strategies to make your personal brand is to “tell a story” to your audience. As well as each video that I uploaded tell a story. My running story and my LDR (long-distance relationship) story. Unfortunately, the results weren’t as I expected. I’ve got small engagement and only few people who attracted with my story on those videos.  “You’ll never achieve the best branding until you fail a couple times while pushing past your comfort zone.” said Timothy Hoang, CEO of Stories By Tim Inc. 

Keeping a positive attitude and helping others will only help healthily grow your brand in the long run. Remember, ourselves are our brand, my brand is myself. Keep in mind, what is the special things that people always remind about you? That is the impact you leave to them.
Well, if you still confused with your personal brand, you can ask some friends about what kind of thing from you that they always remember? 
The purpose of we are having a personal brand is to sell ourselves, to get clients and build a networking. In this digital era, you can easily to build a strategy to develop your personal branding. In other word, what is your unique point compare to the others?
