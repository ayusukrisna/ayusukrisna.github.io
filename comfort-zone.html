            <section class="post-full-content">
                <div class="kg-card-markdown">
                    <p>I recently interviewed some of my acquaintances about work, and I realized that some of them are choosing to stay in their comfort zone. They told me that they don’t like it if they have to do something new in addition to their regular workload. Here is one of my acquaintance’s story:</p>

<p>I have a friend – lets call him Budi – who has been working as a bartender in a restaurant for a year and a half. He’s in his twenties, and has been a bartender since he left school. Surprisingly, Budi still has exactly the role and responsibilities as the first day he started working. All of his colleagues had either been promoted or moved on to new positions, but he hadn’t. Why? Well, it turned out that whenever his boss asked him to do do something new like preparing an inventory report, Budi would say that he had never learned how to make a report like that when he was at school. “I do apologize sir, I don’t think I’m capable to do that because I have never done it before.”</p>

<p>Budi lost his chance to improve his skillset, and with it lost his chance for a promotion and a better life. If he had taken his boss’s challenge, he could have achieved more and become a trusted employee. He was too afraid to make a mistake, and by trying to avoid failure, he stayed in his comfort zone. Personally, I think that your youth is the best time to take as many opportunities as we can; our mistakes will just become moments where we learned something, and will be less costly than if we made them whilst in a more senior position.</p>

<p>One day, I asked him a question, “Budi, what do you want to achieve at work?”</p>

<p>He seemed confused with my question and scratched his head. He gave me a weird smile and replied, “I’m not sure. I just work and follow the flow. As long as I get my paycheck every month, that is more than enough.”</p>

<p>Alright, I have to respect his point of view. There are two kinds of people; people with a fixed mindset and people with a growth mindset. I think it’s safe to say that Budi has fixed mindset; he doesn’t want to grow, and prefers to stay in his comfort zone. A fixed mindset is the mindset that someone has when they believe nothing can change, or might even prefer nothing to change. People with a fixed mindset tend to avoid challenge, and dislike when someone tries to give them advice and feedback, or try to change something.</p>

<p>Budi doesn’t realize that he can’t be a bartender for years; the world will change around him and he will eventually be replaced by someone younger. Suppose that Budi had a growth mindset instead. He might take challenges, learn how to prepare inventory reports, read books about cocktails and other beverages, watch videos on YouTube about bartender skills, and practice mixing his own drinks. A few years later, he’ll be an individual with a lot of experience and added value, and could rise to become the bar manager or perhaps beyond as a bartending influencer or speaker. There are a lot of things he could achieve.</p>

<p>Here’s the research that I did about people and their mindsets. I gave several of my acquaintances questions, to try to understand their mindset.</p>

<p>My questions were as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is your goal at work environment?</li>
  <li>What will you do when you have a chance to do more thing at work?</li>
  <li>When someone give you a feedback about the quality of your work, how are you going to deal with it?</li>
  <li>One of your colleagues successfully got promoted, how’s your feeling?
Here the summary of their answer in a table below:</li>
</ol>

<p>Eighty percent of the answers showed they’re having growth mindset. 
“In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work —brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck, 2015)</p>

<p>These people have goals, and a vision about the career they’re going to lead. Once they have a goal, they will find a way to make it come true. This is different to people who don’t have a clear vision about their future; they only find excuses.
People with a growth mindset are open for a chance to learn new things. Information and knowledge is now easy to get in the modern age. There are plenty of videos and articles on the internet that we can learn from, as long as we are willing to put in the work.</p>

<p>Growth oriented people can handle criticism, and will try harder for self-improvements. They aren’t overly proud when they’re praised, and they aren’t too down when they’re criticized.</p>

<p>Getting criticism is not easy to handle. We need to have a self-control. It’s okay to be sad when someone criticize you, but take it as an opportunity to grow! One day, you will thankful for the criticism you recieved. As Michelle said above, “criticism is more expensive than compliments”.</p>

<p>A growth mindset is crucial as a driving force to get you out of your comfort zone. Achieving your goals is a process and not a destination. Rather than thinking about what we have accomplished, we should think what to do next. Getting out of our comfort zone leads us to success, creativity, a wider network or contacts, and a greater self-awareness.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with this: Remember that our time on this planet is limited. Live your life as if you will die tomorrow. Don’t be disappointed with what you have, and instead live for fulfillment in the present. Your future depends on what you do today. Either you will thank yourself in five year, or being disappointed… “I wish I had started this five years ago”.</p>
