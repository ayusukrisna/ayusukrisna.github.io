We get tired of having the same routine every day. From getting up in the morning, prepare to work eight (or more!) hours, traveling to and from work, and spend our meager free time on Netflix or social media until we fall asleep and face the same day tomorrow. Then, when the weekend finally comes, it’s fleeting and before we know it, it’s Monday again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out a joke on Facebook recently. It said: “Life isn’t fair. Why does Monday to Friday take five days, but Saturday to Sunday only feels like one day?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a question that I couldn’t answer with a good explanation; why do most people only feel excitement for the weekend? I do that too. I get tired of my work week and I want the weekend to come faster. Sometimes I wish I could even skip the week days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boredom makes us psychologically and emotionally exhausted. Sometimes when we hit the rock bottom, we question ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why am I not passionate about my life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why is my life monotonous?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t change external factors and force them to make you feel ALIVE.
What we can do is start from within. Do the things that make you happy. Go on a solo ‘date’, just yourself. Maybe a walk in nature, or a beer at cozy cafe or a long drive. Just you and your thoughts. How about a movie with yourself? There are tons of things that you can do to divert your mind from the things that are annoying you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying quality time alone is important to me. A few times per month, I take a break and just do my hobbies on my own; I escape from my reality or from my daily activities and solely focus on the story of a movie. I just lay down in my bed and spend my time without much thinking and only focus on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, if I have enough energy left after work, I will run three to five kilometers  - just to release the stress. When we have a hard time at work, what we need the most is to release our work-stress and burdens! Sometimes, I don’t have energy; I’m just exhausted. In those times, I might cry on may home. Cry out of loud where nobody can hear or see me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the point of giving yourself alone time? Well, it means that you can explore these things without the pressures and judgments that others may impose. Having time to yourself is critical for growth and personal development. Instead of worrying about the needs, interests, and opinions that others may have, alone time lets you focus on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my workplace environment, we always think about other people first over ourselves. For instance, we care for and prioritize our family, our partner, and even our colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a married friend that barely has any time for herself. She’s always busy with housework, looking after her husband and kids, and doing her day job too. The stress she has makes her looks older than her age. Whenever I ask her if she’s okay, she just smiles and nods; even when I know she’s definitely not okay. What would she have to do to have time for herself? Ignore the needs of her family? Of course not! In my opinion, she should discuss it with her husband, and ask if he can help more so that she can have time to her self away from her busy life. Even if it’s just half a day here and there to go to Salon for a spa or beauty service. If she’s happier, she will bring more joy to her family, I can guarantee it! Good moods create better relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having quality time alone can help you to improve your mental health by giving you the opportunity to purge the toxicity from your life and allow you to “mentally reset”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found an article online listing 10 benefits of spending time alone; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tanyadalton.com/blog/10-benefits-of-spending-time-alone&quot;&gt;you can click this link to read about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that NOBODY cannot help you except YOURSELF. Take care of your body, mind and soul, and live the life you want. If there’s something you can’t change, don’t think too hard about it. Try to manage what you can - start by controlling your mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Life" /><summary type="html">Our daily activities can sometimes make us stressed and fed up.

&lt;p&gt;This year, I tried so hard to grow to be a better person and take small steps to reach my goals, but I feel like I didn’t make any progress. For two weeks this month, (August 2021) I just lay in my bed (in Indonesia we called it as rebahan), and didn’t want to do anything even thought I already knew exactly what I should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 18th of August, I took a Swab Antigen Test because I had a fever and a headache for a few days that progressed on to a cough, blocked nose, and then finally to a loss of my ability to smell and taste. Yeah, I got Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I hoped that I would be able to avoid contracting the virus. I already received two doses of vaccine in March 2021. Why did I still get the virus? Well, my vaccine only helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms. I’m glad that I didn’t become breathless, as that sounds dreadful. My body still felt okay when I took test, just a little weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the doctor told me that I tested positive, I had mix feelings such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I won’t able to work, and will receive a reduced salary&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will happen to my body because of the virus?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can I spend days only in one room?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Will my family have to isolate as well?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received many DMs on Instagram. My friends encouraged me and told me that they had prayed for me. My colleagues also texted me to wish that I get well soon. I’m happy that many people cared enough about me to send their well wishes whilst I was ill. It helped me have faith that I can get through this situation. One thing that I need to do if I want to recover quickly is to be happy and have a positive mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, when I lay down in my bed, I stared at the ceiling and was full of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to start creating content, but why don’t I create consistently?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to be a productive person, but why do I just lay in bed and scroll on social media?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I want to have another income stream, but why didn’t I start anything?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was confused, and I really felt that I lost hope. I’m not sure if this was because of the virus; perhaps it made both my body and my mind enter an unhealthy state or whatever. I knew that I should jump out of my bed, stop scrolling, and take action, but my body didn’t want to help me get up from my comfort zone. Alright, the lazy voice in my head wins. I fell into a deep, dark state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, one of my friends said to me, “It’s okay if you want to take a break from your activities. You have been given a time to think and evaluate yourself. Calm down. Once you accept the feeling, you will come back again full of spirit! Get well soon Shina!”
After I read that message, I felt better and accepted the feeling. I knew that it’s possible to heal and achieve a healthy body and mind again. Sometimes we just need to get through the hard time first. It’s normal to feel stressed, confused, anxious, or angry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Difficult times always teach us the most important lessons about life and growth.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend is right, this is an opportunity for me to take a break, connect with myself, heal my body, and reflect during my self-isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the following quote very helpful for those of us who face a hard time in life:&lt;/p&gt;

I found it challenging to find a job at that time, especially because I didn’t have any specific goals. My only purpose was to find a job after I graduate, regardless of what it was. I applied to become a banker, a financier, general accounting, anything that was related to my studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my friend asked me if I wanted to work in a hotel as a Accounting Receivable and Income Audit. YES, for sure I want it. I was a little anxious because I hadn’t learned about the hospitality sector whilst in university; I learned about private companies, services, trade, and manufacturing, instead. I also couldn’t speak English well. As you know, if you want to work in a customer-facing industry like hospitality, you should be good at communicating in English. Fortunately, those things didn’t stop me, and I successfully got that job in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flies fast. It has now been 5 years since my first day of employment. I would like to summarise some of the things I’ve been through and what I have learned from my experiences. Hopefully these lessons can help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/shinaptt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Enjoy Shina!&quot; title=&quot;Work in the Restaurant&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;be-persistent&quot;&gt;Be Persistent&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first day at work was so challenging. My co-workers weren’t very nice to me, and talked about me behind my back because I was slow to understand my task list. The Chief Accountant (CA) wasn’t helpful either, she just asked me how I was doing and didn’t assist me nor give me advice when I told her I was struggling. For the first three days after work, I cried at night because I felt overwhelmed and burdened. I almost gave up and decided to send my resignation letter. Eventually, I steeled myself and thought “I shouldn’t quit. I have to conquer this challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my boss told the CA about my low performance, he gave me one week to understand my job and handle it alone. If I couldn’t, then I would have to quit. What did I do to pass the challenge? I learned how to make a Daily Sales Report, and stayed at work until midnight to try to understand the accounting system. A security officer even came to my office to tell me I needed to go home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that my co-workers were only showing a façade of friendliness towards me, but I didn’t let it stop me and I didn’t take it personally. I remember that multiple of those same co-workers later went on to resign together because of some reason or another, and they were pushing me to join their action. Once again, I thought about my future and decided that I still needed to gain more experience, so I chose to stay and survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;have-a-willingness-to-learn-new-things&quot;&gt;Have A Willingness to Learn New Things&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best investment in life? Investing in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I know I couldn’t speak English very well, I chose to use my whole month’s salary to enroll on an English Class at the English First (EF) organisation for six months. I made significant improvement and by the end of the course I was able to speak English at an Intermediate level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 my boss offered me to join the Tax Brevet A/B class for IDR 5.000.000 ($350). I was so excited and took the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the pandemic began, and my salary was reduced from having to Work from Home, I chose to study using online courses from Udemy to improve my skills with Microsoft Excel and creating financial reports. I also enrolled to learn the fundamentals of Digital Marketing from a course on Google Digital Garage, and even start to learn coding on Codecademy so that I could start my own website with some help from my boyfriend. My Udemy and Codecademy courses are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;develop-a-tough-mentality&quot;&gt;Develop A Tough Mentality&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you step up at your own work place, make sure you have good mental health and are strong enough to face the unexpected things. Earning money is not as easy as spending it. There are a lot of factors that affect your performance at work, such as the pressure from your boss, your co-workers badmouthing you, having a messy desk, your lunch time, and so on. It is easy for us to get stressed from our workplace, which is why we need to manage our mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get scolded by your boss, you need to have the kind of thought to realise that ‘This is a normal thing, I made a mistake and that is why my boss scolded me. My boss wants the best from me’. Try to think from your boss’ perspective; he or she didn’t scold you because they hate you, but because they expect more from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard when your co-workers say bad things about you; it’s natural to feel sad and perhaps even be ashamed to face them. But remind yourself: what is your reason to have a job? You still have debt, you still want to be able to make investments, to take your family abroad, or whatever your motivation is. Try to not listen to the naysayers, and keep moving forward. Prove to them that you have the ability to achieve and impress. There is no point giving them the silent treatment. Just work as professionally, as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember a story about The Tiny Frog:
There are a group of tiny frogs that arranged a competition to reach the top of a tower. A large number of frogs gathered to watch the competition and see if any of the frogs can accomplish it. When the race began, no-one in the audience believed that it could be done. Some shout to the tiny frogs “It’s way too difficult”, others follow: “They will NEVER make it to the top” and “Not a chance. The tower is too high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participant frogs one by one fell from the middle of the tower, except for those who kept trying to jump step by step to climb higher. 
More and more tiny frogs became tired and gave up. The crowd kept shouting that they wouldn’t make it. There was only one tiny frog that still continued to jump and refused to fail. He put in all of his effort. Finally, this tiny frog reached the top of the tower and won the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the participants frogs wanted to know how he was able to succeed in reaching the top of the tower. It’s because the tiny frog was DEAF. He didn’t listen to the audience, so wasn’t deterred, and still believed it was possible. He thought the audience was cheering for him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;responsibility-and-added-value&quot;&gt;Responsibility and Added Value&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every position has it’s responsibilities. As an accountant, my work is full of responsibilities that must be completed perfectly. My position covers essential things such as financial information, bank accounts, etc, and the company could enter legal and financial troubles if I completed my responsibilities incorrectly. But the workplace isn’t just about responsibilities; all accountants can create a financial report or manage a bank account; what value do you add to the company that wouldn’t be added by someone else? It is important to find something that means your company can’t easily replace you with someone new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my answer from Pak Tung Desem Waringin book’s WorkLess EarnMore (Part 1). He wrote that if we want to be able to add value and become different to other people, we need to take more responsibilities, extra work, and be the best at your own position. It is important to make your boss and the upper management recognize the quality of your work and your importance. 
There are three steps to be the best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;we consciously determine that we want to be the best&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;have a strong reason to be the best, for the people we love&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learn from the best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tungdesembook.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WorkLess EarnMore!&quot; title=&quot;WorkLess EarnMore Book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;honest-and-trust&quot;&gt;Honest and Trust&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a dishonest person, you likely won’t have a career for long. An absolute condition to have long and successful career is that you have to be able to be trusted. As an accountant, it is very risky when we work with money. It is easy to manipulate cash. It’s necessary to write down and attach every document when we do the cash in and cash out transactions for the company. 
Once, I had an experience where I had to choose between my integrity and my boss’s order. For a few months, I followed my boss, because I needed him to trust me, but it went against my integrity as an accountant. I thought that if I kept doing what I was doing, it will impact to other parties and bad scenarios can arise. So, I chose to approach someone that can help me face this issue. Finally, we managed to solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some ways to prove that you are an honest person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep your words and commitments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you say “I will finish the report by Monday next week.”, then no matter what happens, you have to finish it by that time. If you couldn’t because something significant has happen, it is important to inform the relevant parties immediately. Show your manner and that you have good intentions to stick to your responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay focused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so easily to get distraction by just a single notification from your phone. It’s important to stay focused on the job until you achieve the results you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you inevitably make a mistake, don’t be afraid to admit to it and take your action to fix your mistake. It is hard to say something like “I’m sorry I made a mistake”, or “I do apologize that I got it wrong”, but it’s important to do it. Then, don’t make the same mistake twice, because it will show that you aren’t capable to learn your lessons. Show that you learn from your experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those were five lessons that I learned from five years in a working environment, but I will continue learning lessons and gaining more experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the law of 10.000 hours, to become an expert, one needs to do the activity that he/she is engaged in for 10 thousand hours. 
Evaluate your work, learn from other people and don’t be high and mighty just because you think you’re smart enough to accomplish something. Stay humble and keep improving yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Learning" /><summary type="html">I graduated from university in June 2016 with a bachelor’s degree in Economics.

They told me that they don’t like it if they have to do something new in addition to their regular workload. Here is one of my acquaintance’s story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a friend – lets call him Budi – who has been working as a bartender in a restaurant for a year and a half. He’s in his twenties, and has been a bartender since he left school. Surprisingly, Budi still has exactly the role and responsibilities as the first day he started working. All of his colleagues had either been promoted or moved on to new positions, but he hadn’t. Why? Well, it turned out that whenever his boss asked him to do do something new like preparing an inventory report, Budi would say that he had never learned how to make a report like that when he was at school. “I do apologize sir, I don’t think I’m capable to do that because I have never done it before.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budi lost his chance to improve his skillset, and with it lost his chance for a promotion and a better life. If he had taken his boss’s challenge, he could have achieved more and become a trusted employee. He was too afraid to make a mistake, and by trying to avoid failure, he stayed in his comfort zone. Personally, I think that your youth is the best time to take as many opportunities as we can; our mistakes will just become moments where we learned something, and will be less costly than if we made them whilst in a more senior position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, I asked him a question, “Budi, what do you want to achieve at work?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seemed confused with my question and scratched his head. He gave me a weird smile and replied, “I’m not sure. I just work and follow the flow. As long as I get my paycheck every month, that is more than enough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, I have to respect his point of view. There are two kinds of people; people with a fixed mindset and people with a growth mindset. I think it’s safe to say that Budi has fixed mindset; he doesn’t want to grow, and prefers to stay in his comfort zone. A fixed mindset is the mindset that someone has when they believe nothing can change, or might even prefer nothing to change. People with a fixed mindset tend to avoid challenge, and dislike when someone tries to give them advice and feedback, or try to change something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budi doesn’t realize that he can’t be a bartender for years; the world will change around him and he will eventually be replaced by someone younger. Suppose that Budi had a growth mindset instead. He might take challenges, learn how to prepare inventory reports, read books about cocktails and other beverages, watch videos on YouTube about bartender skills, and practice mixing his own drinks. A few years later, he’ll be an individual with a lot of experience and added value, and could rise to become the bar manager or perhaps beyond as a bartending influencer or speaker. There are a lot of things he could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the research that I did about people and their mindsets. I gave several of my acquaintances questions, to try to understand their mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is your goal at work environment?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What will you do when you have a chance to do more thing at work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When someone give you a feedback about the quality of your work, how are you going to deal with it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of your colleagues successfully got promoted, how’s your feeling?
Here the summary of their answer in a table below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;NAME&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;What is your goal at work environment?&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;What will you do when you have a chance to do more thing at work?&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;When someone give you a feedback about the quality of your work, how are you going to deal with it?&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;One of your colleagues successfully got promoted, how’s your feeling?&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Michelle&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;As Marketing, I think perhaps the main goal in my working environment, is to ensure the brand, team communication, guest service and overall image is always well-kept and in the highest standard, whatever the cost. However, the most important goal for me would be to guide my team to reach their fullest potential and achieve their goals and dreams. To be able to contribute to your team’s achievements is more fulfilling than the work itself.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If I am given more work, I usually do a lot of multitasking while just taking it 1 day at a time.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I handle criticism very well actually, having being brought up in the city where the working environment is pretty tough and hectic. I just listen. Criticism is more expensive than compliments, so take it if its useful and if its not useful, then use it as a fuel to prove them wrong.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Happy of course. Let’s celebrate their promotion! Haha&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Nanda&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Create a system that can make people work easier and can be an identity of my office&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I’ll take that chance as long as it doesn’t out from my main responsibility&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I’ll say thank you and try to do better&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Absolutely happy. I’m not a crab. I always support my colleagues to achieve their goals&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Diva&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;My Goals is giving the best at work. When we are giving the best it’s mean I do the best for my performance and also for the company side, and from there I know how far is our skills and performance, so I can improve more and more&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I’m very happy to get more to do because that means they are trusting us for doing that job, and they are know I can do and handle it.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If someone give the good feedback I’m grateful, it means I did a good job. if someone give the bad feedback I’m gratefull as well, so they are telling us what bad things in our self, then we know what we need to improves.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Of course I’m jealous, they can get promoted but why I can’t? But from there I learn something, so I need to push my self more than before, and Improve what is my weaknesses.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ahmad&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Comfortable at work and to support each other&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Give the best to achieve what they want from me, even it doesn’t meet their need at least I gave my effort.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Always do the best because the biggest responsible is to our God.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;It’s so hard not to be jealous, but I will take it as a motivation to be better and of course I will congrate my colleague&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Topan&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;My goal in the work environment is to gain experience, knowledge and find relationships.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If there is an excessive opportunity at work, I will take full advantage of the opportunity. For example, improving product quality and service quality so that it can provide greater benefits to the company.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;To be honest, I will be very happy with criticism from other people, it can increase my enthusiasm and improve myself in providing services to others in the future&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;To be honest, I don’t have a problem if my colleagues promote first than me. So, that way I can introspect why this is so and look for the advantages of my friend from what side, that way I can encourage myself so that I can be like them&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bhunz&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;People do work based on SOP, no less and no more. Everything is in accordance with the portion&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yes, I do when my work done&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Listen, notes, and evaluated.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Feeling put less effort than him&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sagung&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;My goals at work environment are I wanna have a positive vibes like good friend which can be a good team work, can cover each other’s flaw, and boss can appreciate his workers without distinguishing&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I will take all chances at my work to improve my skill, even if my boss will compensate more money or not, because I believe effort won’t betray the result&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If someone give me feedback, I’ll thank for it. Cause it’ll can improve my self to be better&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I’ll feel a little bit jealous, but it makes me realize I have to fight more to get a successful result&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ainun&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;As Human Resources, to coordinate people within an organization to achieve the organization’s goals.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I’ll take it, meaning I’ve to do multitasking and that’s fine as long as I could manage my work and time as well. That would be not easy, but there are always things to learn.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I’ll happy to hear what they thought, for me doesn’t matter good or bad, later on, I’ll filter which ones I think are good because I’m the one who understands what’s best for me&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Of course happy for them, Everybody deserved something better&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Arix&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;My Goal is keep motivated and love the job so by this everyday will be easier for us.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If I have A chance to do more think at work, well for me I just do it without thinking anything in the beginning and also will learn something more interesting.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If there is a feedback about my quality of work , well I’ll take it of course and really appreciate what someone said to me , this think actually I’m looking for because by this i can change what is supposed to be changed from myself.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;One of my colleagues got promoted, of course I’ll be very happy with that.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ana&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I am planning to be at Marketing Head Position&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Keep going with my integrity, increasing sales and keep commited to give the best contribution  to the company, also spread positivity and hard work with all my colleagues&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I will receive it as a compliment, if it is an appreciantion feed back, but if it is a critique I will review my working method, my attitude and develop based on the company’s requirement&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I am definately very happy for them, and it gives me spirit that I can have the same chance. That also mean that the company is in a healthy condition and perfect system in term of supporting their employess carrier.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Yeni&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;My goal in my work environment are first, get many positive connections, that able to improve me as professional and individual. Professional means that I can improve my skills, get to know people who work in the same industry and clients. as individual means become mature, able to think in the wider view, able to work with different type of people. second, skills and knowledge. as you might know, my basic is Language/Literature. This subject is too wide and on the first time I looking for a job I don’t even know what type of work I should apply for. So in the work environment, I expect to improve my skill and know what I can learn, what I can do. Hence I also expect I can learn so many skill as much as I can and allowed&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;If I get a chance to do more thing at work, I honestly will take it. As I mentioned before I expect to able to learn a lot of things. I love to learn but I don’t want to teach junior. When I have more skills/knowledge more than any other colleagues, of course I will get recognition to get improving salary. but never expected to get promotion. Like I said I don’t want to teach junior and have to responsible to other people job.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When people give me a feedback, will surely appreciated. Its mean they take times to see my works, but need to see who they are. If the feedback is negative, than I will make sure if what they mentioned is really bad or just jealousy. I will try to check by myself and I will ask a feedback to other colleague too. If the comments is positive, I have to make sure that it was really compliment/ acknowledgement or just someone who have different motives.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I will happy if one my colleague got promotion. It is means I have a friend who have a high position and I am proud of it. Like I mentioned before I don’t really expected to get promotion since I am not a leader type. If the promotion not include responsible for other and only more work and salary, I will gladly accept but not about control people. I am not good at it, and don’t want to.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Ian&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I am very grateful for God who has entrusted it to me, it will not end there, maybe in the next 5 years I must have a position that is more than now by exploring the potential that exists within me to reach the level where God has entrusted it to me.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;What I do is if given more opportunities I will realize my ideas in the development of the company and I will bring that success to my homeland so that they can judge me will not go home without success.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;When I get advice from a work relative where there are 2 things, namely positive/negative responses, 1 thing I have to think about is all positive because there are people’s responses that don’t please us even though we still have to be able to accept it positively, that’s the advantage I have to use so that can stimulate enthusiasm so that they can create ideas to contribute to work.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;In the world of work there must be a team, a solid team must have personal challenges, each one makes a strong, firm person and confident. Competition in the world of work is definitely there but remember you are not alone in achieving it all, you have a faithful god who accompanies you every step of the way, do good, focus on work, make your good coworkers to be better than him and always rely on God in every achievement of your career&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Agastya&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Don’t have any specific goal at work, but the main thinks just do your best and giving all of our experience to finished your job as quickly as possible. Of course we keep to socialise and solid as teamwork.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Thats a big chance to test your skills right, new things at work sometimes giving us a new experience and new problem solving as a solo or a team. So do not avoid it and face it without a doubt to push your limit.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;As a graphic designer sometimes myself and other team member got a compliment or if we had a bad day some customer will complaint about our work. The problems sometimes are classic, we missunderstood about the brief or the design tastes between our team and customer are different. So we need to do apologise, telling what the problems, and giving the extra time to fix these problem by communicate deeply with customers.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;I could say I’m a person who doesn’t really pursue positions, as long as my skills are in the right place I’m quite satisfied.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent of the answers showed they’re having growth mindset. 
“In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work —brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck, 2015)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people have goals, and a vision about the career they’re going to lead. Once they have a goal, they will find a way to make it come true. This is different to people who don’t have a clear vision about their future; they only find excuses.
People with a growth mindset are open for a chance to learn new things. Information and knowledge is now easy to get in the modern age. There are plenty of videos and articles on the internet that we can learn from, as long as we are willing to put in the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth oriented people can handle criticism, and will try harder for self-improvements. They aren’t overly proud when they’re praised, and they aren’t too down when they’re criticized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting criticism is not easy to handle. We need to have a self-control. It’s okay to be sad when someone criticize you, but take it as an opportunity to grow! One day, you will thankful for the criticism you recieved. As Michelle said above, “criticism is more expensive than compliments”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growth mindset is crucial as a driving force to get you out of your comfort zone. Achieving your goals is a process and not a destination. Rather than thinking about what we have accomplished, we should think what to do next. Getting out of our comfort zone leads us to success, creativity, a wider network or contacts, and a greater self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with this: Remember that our time on this planet is limited. Live your life as if you will die tomorrow. Don’t be disappointed with what you have, and instead live for fulfillment in the present. Your future depends on what you do today. Either you will thank yourself in five year, or being disappointed… “I wish I had started this five years ago”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Life" /><category term="Learning" /><summary type="html">I recently interviewed some of my acquaintances about work, and I realized that some of them are choosing to stay in their comfort zone. They told me that they don’t like it if they have to do something new in addition to their regular workload. Here is one of my acquaintance’s story:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Do Women Have an Expiration Date?</title><link href="/women-expiry-date" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Do Women Have an Expiration Date?" /><published>2021-04-20T04:21:20+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-20T04:21:20+00:00</updated><id>/women-expiry-date</id><content type="html" xml:base="/women-expiry-date">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I watched a Japanese Drama called &lt;a href=&quot;https://asianwiki.com/Love_and_Fortune&quot;&gt;Love and Fortune&lt;/a&gt; (Koi no Tsuki).  I’ll be briefly outlining the plot, but only so I can emphasize the things I took away from the drama. I identified with a lot that that the main lead went through in the story, and it made me think a lot about my own life and my romances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is about a 30-year-old woman called Wako Taira, who is in a relationship with a man called Fuuta Aoi. They’ve been in a relationship for four years and have lived together for three. Unfortunately, Wako has started to become frustrated with him. He only makes enough every month to pay rent and to buy food. Wako herself works part-time at the cinema and doesn’t earn much, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/koinotsuki1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Koi No Tsuki 1!&quot; title=&quot;Wako and Iko&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/koinotsuki2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Koi No Tsuki 2!&quot; title=&quot;Wako and Fuuta&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They spend their time at work, have dinner together, make love, and then sleep. The next day is the same, and then the next, ad infinitum. Fuuta isn’t ready to ask Wako to marry him because he doesn’t have enough money to raise children. Meanwhile, Wako is feeling societal pressure to get married because of her age. As time flies by, she eventually falls in love with a high school student called Yumeaki Iko; she has an affair with him. She’s has a dilemma; she loves Iko very much, but feels that Fuuta is the safe choice. She fears that she wouldn’t be able to find someone else her age if things went wrong with Iko. The whole story revolves around the idea that whatever decision she makes, she will get the consequences. Later, Wako also tries to get a proper job in a company, but is turned down many times because - once again - ‘her age’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in today’s society, women have an expiration date, for sure! If you are an adult woman, and your age enters your thirties, your chance of getting pregnant is less than 50%. Your chance to find a guy to date is also getting smaller, and it also becomes harder to get a new job. History and science have proven that women are less desirable once they hit their thirties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always been a fear for me as well. I’m scared that I won’t get married before I turn 30, and that I wouldn’t have a good career by that age, and so on. From this show, I learned that I shouldn’t waste my time just doing my ‘boring’ every day activities because time flies so fast. Without realizing it, we are already old. If I were Wako, I would regret not having done anything meaningful in my 20’s. If you aren’t careful, your life will be over before it has begun, and you will feel that it’s ‘already too late’ to begin a new thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the ending was satisfying; both main characters split, grew, and found their purpose individually. They later found each other again, and fulfilled their dreams together. In this story, marriage isn’t everything, having a kid isn’t so important either; only your happiness is. There’s no point getting married to the wrong guy and living a miserable life, or even trying to raise a kid when your financial situation is messy. I feel sorry for the children that go through a hard life just because their parent wasn’t ready for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, you also have to consider your family and your society as well. When you choose to fight for your own happiness, a lot of folks following the mainstream will view you harshly. You will receive daily questions and comments like, “when will you get married?”; “why hasn’t he proposed to you yet?”; “nobody will take care of you if you don’t have kids”; “you shouldn’t just earn money without starting a family”; and blah blah blah… Whilst it would be great for your family to support your decisions and not pushing those kinds of things, it’s sadly just not the reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you my own story. Right now, I’m still 26 years old, but unfortunately in my society here in Bali, I’m considered OLD, and will be undesirable soon. My uncle once told me that I have to get married ASAP or I won’t be able to do that once I enter my thirties. His daughter, who is younger than me, is already a wife and had a child. His daughter has the stereotypical ‘perfect life’, I think. He also suggested to me to marry a local Balinese guy; right now I’m dating a foreigner. I just said to him, I have my own goals and ambitions. Life isn’t just about getting married, having kids, and then dying. I want to embrace my life and make it meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to bury my dreams just to follow the normal things in society. Everyone lives and achieves things in their own time, at their own pace. We are not in a running race, are we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This train of thought also raises a natural question; what can we do as women to not be considered ‘expired’ by our thirties? For me, this boils down to having good habits and living a good lifestyle. Exercise, workouts, skincare products, sleeping time, and what we eat all matter. South Korea has a culture that values many of those things for women, and, many of their actresses look much younger than their real age! Maintain your body and soul, avoid stress, and implement a healthy life, and you might be able to ‘remain young’ regardless of your real years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what society things, I believe that as women, we still shine regardless of our age. Nevertheless, please take care of your mental health and you body; leave toxic people and environments. There are a lot of things that we can do than just waiting for our ‘expiry date’. Soon, you will find the right partner, or you will get a beautiful career, or you will achieve whatever it is you want from life, and you will live your goals! Let’s be empowered women, with vision and grace!&lt;/p&gt;

Do you want to change it, and grow to be a better person – to have a beautiful life? What do you want to be?’ - Those questions were always in my head, until recently I got the answer. Yes, I want to change my life and reach my goals. The next question is what step should I take? I realize that if I want to change something, I have to start within myself. Then again, which part should I change first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I found a sponsor post on my Instagram feed that encouraged me to ‘Take this Personal Growth Challenge for 28 days’. I took the quiz, enrolled to their program, and they sent me my self-development plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/selfgrowthready.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Successfully Registered!&quot; title=&quot;Self-development Plan is Ready!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program runs for four weeks, covering a topic each week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Productivity – Get actionable tips and tricks to become a high-performer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Money and Career – Focus on impressive career and earn money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Happiness – Discover clear and simple ways to kick-off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/PersonalPlan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28 Summaries Books!&quot; title=&quot;28 Summaries Books&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 28 summaries of the best books to achieve my goals. Here is the flow, I should check my plan on daily basis, read each summary of the book for 15 minutes and celebrate the progress. Thick each book every time I finish read them. 
Since starting the program, I consistently read a few pages of books every day, and yeah, I can feel the difference! I have been feeling more positive and that every day, I am one percent closer to being a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I can honestly say that I didn’t even think about reading books; especially non-fiction. When I was in junior high school, I loved reading comics, though I didn’t really like to read a novel, or even just a page full of words. However, I have since realized that successful people love to read books. I think that there is so much knowledge to be gained, and that’s why they read them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by reading a non-fiction book regarding financial and personal growth a year ago. At first, I didn’t enjoy reading it; I felt sleepy after reading just a few words. I didn’t pick the book up again until six months later, in early 2021. I started to put all of my effort, and focus into the book and read carefully. I found that not only can I understand it, but I can get a real benefit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/atomic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Atomic Habits!&quot; title=&quot;Atomic Habits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! I found out that reading is not such a boring activity. Reading helped my brain to memorize things, to reduce stress, and to increase my vocabulary. I now have so many topics that I can talk about with someone else about the books I have read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In James Clear’s book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/a&gt;, he says that if we want to change our habits, we have to change our identity. Instead of saying, “I want to stop smoking”, you have to say “I’m not a smoker”. In my example, my target is not to finish reading one book, it’s that I’m changing my identity to see myself as a reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading Atomic Habits, I also realized that I had applied this successfully in the past. In 2018, I had wanted to become a runner. My goal wasn’t just to finish a 5km or 10km run in a certain time, but that I should enjoy my runs and do them regularly. I also registered for some running events in 2018 and 2019. The joy when I finished a race is unforgettable. I can now say confidently that, ‘I’m a keen runner’; my identity has changed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal growth is really helping me to develop my soft skills. What are soft skills? Wikipedia said &lt;em&gt;“Soft skills are a combination of people skills, social skills, communication skills, character or personality traits, attitudes, mindsets, career attributes, social intelligence and emotional intelligence.”&lt;/em&gt; In this era, it doesn’t matter if you are an expert in a given field - if your soft skills are zero, then you have no hope. Soft skills are important for explaining yourself, socializing, and career development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the first thing I look for in a person is their manner. Once, I interviewed candidates for a position in the accounting department. I looked into their eyes and asked them questions about the job as well as their personality. I could say that 3 of the 5 candidates have good manners, and that they knew how to open a conversation, how to answer a question confidently and how to impress me as their interviewer. Their soft skills were a very important thing that influenced my hiring decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of books to help you improve your soft skills or to help you grow. Don’t think that reading is a hard thing to do; your unconscious brain will believe it and you will become discouraged. If you start with just one paragraph first, you can slowly improve to reading one page per day, until eventually you will lose track of time and forget that you are reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have learned that you can start to change your habits and begin self-development just by reading a book. Set a target, meet it consistently, and take the benefits!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Life" /><category term="Things I Like" /><summary type="html">‘Do you feel like your life is stuck in place?

Transfer to your savings account? Pay your bills? Buy something online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think that share some amount of money to people who need our help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, sharing what we have bring a positive impact to our lives. Sharing isn’t just about money. We can share our knowledge, time, and support, too. There is a sense of relief when we are able to share and help others. Sincerity is the main key of sharing. No matter how much money you give to others, if you want something back, it won’t add anything to your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I met a woman called Padma. She was a guest in my workplace. She asked me where she can meet people who live in poverty. She and her partner will celebrate their anniversary, and they want to share with other people on that day. They want to help and spread their love. She asked for some suggestion of the kinds of things she can give to them. Her plan is to give 50 bags of rice and primer needs, blankets, and so on. She and her partner are so generous and have lovely hearts. She is inspiring to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I feed stray dogs and cats with leftover food. I feel like my heart is full of happiness when I see the animals eat what I gave to them. They are always so hungry and eat very fast. I cannot bear to see an animal in these terrible situations, I feel sorrow and want to help them. I don’t understand why some people harm animals? One of my friends on Facebook posted that he found kittens inside the box and two of them were dead. Somebody had thrown the box away with the kittens inside. I’m hateful when I saw that post. I offered a help to buy cat milk for them. I feel grateful that there are still many good people in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kitabisa2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kita Bisa&quot; title=&quot;KitaBisa App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, there is an App that we can use to help people by donating through that App. It’s called KitaBisa (in English this translates to “We Can”). I already used it for few a months - every time I got my paycheck I donate a little. I can choose to donate to anyone and it’s very easy to use. Can you imagine if you were in a bad situation, and nobody helped you? So, I try my best to help people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals in 2021 is that I will donate and make an event in an orphanage. I did something similar to this in 2012 with my group campus. We were laughing, caring and loving and the children had a good time too. They deserve to be happy and feel loved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Life" /><category term="Things I Like" /><summary type="html">When you get your paycheck every month, what will you do first?

&lt;h6 id=&quot;2021-a-year-full-of-blessings&quot;&gt;2021, A Year Full of Blessings&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019, I thought 2020 will be a great year to reach one of my goals (to work abroad). However, the corona virus outbreak hit not only China but also the whole world. Many people lost their job, the economic drop and this phenomenon force us to stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early 2020, I made a plan to visit Kuala Lumpur to meet my boyfriend in April. Yeah, I shouldn’t buy a ticket because now I couldn’t refund it. Since the last time we’ve been together, it’s been a year we can’t see each other because of COVID 19. Fortunately, we manage to keep our communication and our relationship is going smoothly even sometimes we argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I look back about my work life, many things happened. I had hard time for 2 quarters in the beginning of 2020. I worked with heavy feelings, burdened, and almost lost my job. However, I tried to survive and faced it. ‘Whatever happens let it happen’. When many people lost their job, I’m successfully survive and solved the problem at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the beginning of 2021 brought some surprises. First, the new variant of COVID 19 is rapidly spreading. In Bali, the case is also increasing and some of my friends are positive. Another one is Sriwijaya Air crashed into the sea and killed all the passenger. My deep condolences for all the crews and passengers on that plane, rest in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t control world events, but I can control how I respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay to have resolutions every year, it’s okay if you can’t achieve a few of them, it’s okay to continue fight for your goals in the next year, it’s okay… Just, don’t give up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this year will be full of blessings. Here are my resolutions for 2021:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read minimum 6 self-growth books in one year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have body goals and become an influencer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work and Live in Australia / The UK&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve my English skill&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have another stream income&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Meet my boyfriend&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learn another skill such as public speaking&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be more productive than 2020 obviously&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, when I open this post, I can correct the grammar, I can reflect myself if I be a better person in the next year or if I could manage achieve these resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Life" /><summary type="html">2020, A Year Full of Learning 2021, A Year Full of Blessings</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Start Your Gratitude Journal, NOW!</title><link href="/gratitude-journal" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Start Your Gratitude Journal, NOW!" /><published>2020-11-28T18:59:50+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-28T18:59:50+00:00</updated><id>/gratitude-journal</id><content type="html" xml:base="/gratitude-journal">&lt;p&gt;Are you complaining about your life? Or are you feeling grateful with what you already have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;always jealous to see the success of others (the grass is greener on the other side)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;and the opposite is always grateful because there is someone who isn’t as lucky as him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to watch a video on youtube, his channel called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxh4haOxlsg&amp;amp;t=16s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tom MC Ifle&lt;/a&gt; and in this video Mr. Tom tells that the power of gratitude journal is so amazing. When he had so much debt and serious problem in his life, he started to write gratitude for everything he already has into a book. He is healthy, he has beautiful daughter, he eats three times a day, he has a house to shelter, and many things that he has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start to show your gratitude, you start to receive blessing. You can be happy easily, even with a small thing. Less complaining and attract the good vibes.
Since I watched his video, he encourages me to do the same thing. Then I bought a small book and I’ve started to write every night before I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I have so many things to grateful for. You know, we live in this world always accompanied by problems. There are 4 kinds of problem we always face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love / relationship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Family issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lack of money / in debt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever problems you are facing right now, be strong! This too shall pass.
Hopefully keeping a gratitude journal can help you feel better and attract positive things into your life.
I had already 2 gratitude journals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/buku_jurnal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Gratitude Journals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than two months keeping this gratitude and I start to find a solution with the problem I face. It’s not settled yet, but I enjoy the progress. I know everything will be alright, step by step until I can get out of this problem. Focus with what you want not with what you afraid will happen.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, some of my friends got scammed by someone they thought they trust. Let me tell you the stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My friend&lt;/em&gt; - let’s call her Selina - just split up with her long-term boyfriend. She started to use Tinder to fill the void, and got a few matches; one of them was her type. He was handsome, with a good, high-salaried job, and lived alone (unfortunately, his family had passed on). His name is Bruce. Selina and Bruce were texting and calling each other every day. Due to his work circumstances, Bruce couldn’t make video call which is for me is a bit weird. He also said about hacking the network from his workplace just to be able make a video call with Selina. Bruce told Selina that his workplace has strict rules such as you can’t make a call with your boyfriend or girlfriend only wife or husband. It’s forbidden to do video call with someone who is not part of your family, because Bruce’s company will think that you share the confidential information. Yeah, something like that. The staff from Bruce’s company get their salary with virtual money and they don’t have any cash in hand. It’s getting weirder right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Bruce successfully made Selina believe him, then he starts to asked some money to Selina. At first, Selina felt strange about this, as her know that Bruce earns a lot of money from his job and why he needs her money? But she has been transferred the amount to a strange guy account. The day after she transferred the money, Bruce asked another money again to her. I already told Selina ‘BE AWARE OF A SCAMMER’, I also showed her a case about a woman scammed with her Tinder guy. However, Selina seems pissed off to me. I told her again, “please don’t transfer your money to him, I have a bad feeling about this”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t cry over spilled milk is the best idiom for Selina. She didn’t listen to me and lost her money to a scammer guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to tell you from this story are do not believe too easily with a person you never met with, anything about money is very sensitive, do background checking like knowing his other social media account and prove it with video call if he is as real as on his photo profile. After Selina realize got scammed, she showed me an Instagram account about the guy from Tinder. This guy actually is not Indonesian and the scammer took his photos to commit a crime. Many girls being victims already. Hopefully no more Selina in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the second story about my friend lost her 10 million rupiah through the “arisan online”. What is the arisan? An arisan is a form of Rotating Savings and Credit Association in Indonesian culture, a form of Microfinance. Generally, the arisan is a social gathering that takes place at a fixed interval (this being an informal social network this may be variable), at each member’s home in turn. (Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My another friend&lt;/em&gt; called Susan got an offer to join ‘arisan online’ through Facebook. The member of this arisan were come from various background such as housewife, teacher, doctor, employee, etc. Susan has joined this arisan because the scammer told her that Susan will get a lot of interest if she gives some amount to the leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you transfer 500.000 to the leader and has five members in that arisan. This 500.000 will become 700.000 in the next 30 days. You don’t know anything about the other member and you communicate with them only through social media. You also need to pay the administration fee for 50.000.
If we use our logical and critical, there is something fishy. How come somebody gets much money like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people want to be rich, and most of them are afraid to take the risk. They want to get rich instantly without put much effort. You can’t build empire in one night. You will be failed, yes failed is the best teacher and learn to be right from failure decision. Do not be tempted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>shina</name></author><category term="Life" /><summary type="html">BE AWARE, SCAMMER IS EVERYWHERE</summary></entry></feed>
