Hi, I'm an Accountant in one of the restaurant in Bali. Since finishing my studies in June 2016, I have spent four years in the hospitality business, where I have learned to translate a strong theory of accounting into reliable procedures that improved the day to day running of both the hotel and the restaurant I worked at.

When it was time to choose what and whether to study, I chose to spend four years learning more about accounting because it is something I am passionate about. Currently, I learn new skill such as Digital Marketing and Web Development because I want to expand my career.
